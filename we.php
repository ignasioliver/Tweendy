				Twenddy is a twitter-based platform that essentially allows you to keep up with the trending topics on Twitter across the world. It primarily does this by conglomerating the data through an API that is managed by twitter, and thereby functions with a PHP language system to integrate this into a server system.
Behind the server system (as described above), we operate an effortless network through our unique and efficient system so as to streamline information in the form of 3-dimensional bubble charts, representing the volume of tweets for a specific trending topic to the percentage of the twitter usage populous simultaneously tweeting about such a topic.
it is important to note that in the design of 'bubble charts', this does not take into account any promoted ads that are included within the definition of trends.
The product of which you have a seamless design that is Twenddy, which can offer an alternative to the not so technological savvy individuals who want to be informed of key trending topics in real time! Through and intuitive, funny and messy way, as we love it.
